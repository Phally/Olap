OLAP plugin for CakePHP 1.3

- Two behaviors:
	- FactsBehavior
	- DimensionBehavior

- Docblocks in the classes contain the usage.

- Different example can be found in the test cases.

- IDs for Dimension records are cached for the duration of the
  request/process, to speed up saving multiple fact in one	
  process.

- 100% test coverage

On the TODO list:
- Automagic history in Dimensions using the TimeDimension.
