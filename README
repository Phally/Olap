OLAP plugin for CakePHP

- Two behaviors:
	- FactsBehavior
	- DimensionBehavior
- Docblocks in the classes contain the usage.
- Different example can be found in the test cases.
- 100% test coverage

On the TODO list:
	- A useful form of cache, perhaps just using queryCache...
	- Automagic history in Dimensions using the TimeDimension.
